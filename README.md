✨[View Deployment](https://wmcguire18.github.io/showcase-app-react/)✨

### Overview

Verse Finder is an app designed for users who want focused Biblical quotations by keyword. Utilizing the [GetBible-API](https://scripture.api.bible/livedocs#/Bibles/getBible), users can get a relevant Biblical quotation at the touch of a button.

### Using the App

- Enter a keyword into the text box on the homepage (messages are limited to 200 characters)
- Click the corresponding button to view the randomly generated verse.
- Use the Home Button to return and get a new verse on the same topic.

### Project Wins

The goal of this project was to create an app tailored to suit a niche audience in a short amount of time. After coming across the [[GetBible-API](https://scripture.api.bible/livedocs#/Bibles/getBible), I wanted to help users easily access a verse from the Bible based on a topic of their choosing. I tried to keep the design of this app as simple as possible, to keep it accessible as possible. My biggest win from this project was successfully creating a MVP that met these requirements, and has the potential to help a unique audience.

### What's Next?
